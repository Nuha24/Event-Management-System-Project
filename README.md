## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Event creation and registration
- Information handling
- Fee calculation based on event type and duration
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation
- Object-oriented design using classes and inheritance
- Basic validation and error handling

- To input and store attendee information
- Computes total cost depending on event type, duration, or other parameters
- Shows all event-related and participant data
- Provides user-friendly interface to navigate the program

This project serves as a great beginner-level implementation of C++ OOP concepts such as **classes**, **objects**, **constructors**, **inheritance**, and **encapsulation** while solving a real-world scenario.
